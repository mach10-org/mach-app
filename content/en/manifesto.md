In broad terms, this program aims to be:

## Creating better and fearless humans

Money doesn’t make us happy but not enough can be a source of stress and keep people in a state of fear for their future. Increasing our technical skills, critical thinking and creativity contributes to make us stronger and resilient humans. Being able to choose a job you like, or even better, create the product/job/company you like puts you in control of your life. We strive to create people who have no fear for the future.
An ecosystem

With a carefully constructed educational experience to develop technical skills, cross-cutting skills, and leadership (a knowledge of self coupled with an ability to develop others).
Practical and rigorous

Focus on problem solving skills and practice instead of teaching a few tricks to pass interviews. Just like because you ready 1000 books on how to play piano won’t make you a good piano player. Practice is at the core of what we do. Fun and enjoyable doesn’t mean we’re here to take it easy. We want to set very high standard for ourselves, and we expect the same from students. It’s also the best way to inspire them and help them push their limits.

## Financially accessible to all

Any motivated person who adheres to our code of conduct should be able to join. Our model is designed to optimize the costs while keeping a great learning experience so even a person on social welfare can apply.
An educational experimentation lab

Having a scientific approach and measuring the effects of what we do is essential if we want a system that improves over time. Experiment, measure, learn, share! We believe there is ALWAYS room for improvement.
100% open source

We don’t yet know what legal status this project will have, but the ambition is to have a transparent and open source operation. Our progress will be public, so that others can be inspired freely. That’s also why we want to document the reflections and the research upstream of the school!
